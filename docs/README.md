# Documentation

Start with the section that matches what you are doing. If a word is new to you,
look it up in the [glossary](#glossary) at the bottom of this page.

Everything here describes version 2.1.2. What is public, and how stable it is,
is listed in [`STABILITY.md`](../STABILITY.md).

## New to the framework

1. **[Getting started](getting-started.md).** Build a small module from nothing,
   one step at a time: a page, a JSON endpoint, a console command, a database
   table and a test. About half an hour.
2. **[What is not built](what-is-not-built.md).** Things the framework leaves
   out on purpose, so you do not spend time looking for them.

## Guides

Each guide walks through one task in your own application.

- **[Pages and forms](guides/pages-and-forms.md)**: templates, layouts,
  stylesheets, forms with validation, file uploads, and changing pages you did
  not write.
- **[JSON APIs](guides/json-apis.md)**: API routes, versions, validating input,
  errors, pagination.
- **[Storing data](guides/storing-data.md)**: connecting to a database, creating
  tables, reading and saving records, transactions.
- **[Background work](guides/background-work.md)**: jobs that run later, queue
  workers, retries, tasks on a schedule.
- **[Users and permissions](guides/users-and-permissions.md)**: your own user
  accounts, logging in, protecting pages, roles, API tokens.
- **[Extending other modules](guides/extending-other-modules.md)**: changing what
  another module does with hooks and filters, and depending on another module.
- **[Testing](guides/testing.md)**: testing pages, forms, databases, jobs and
  commands.

## Running an application

- **[Deployment and security](operations/deployment.md)**: setting up the web
  server, and what it must never serve.
- **[Running in production](operations/running.md)**: the steps for a first
  deployment and for every deployment after it, cron, queue workers, and
  running on several servers.
- **[Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)**: symptoms, their causes, and fixes.

## Working on the framework itself

- **[Contributing](contributing/README.md)**: the checks every change must pass,
  and the rules framework code follows.
- **[Development](contributing/development.md)**: tooling, and what is built so
  far.
- **[API stability and releases](contributing/releases.md)**: what each stability
  level promises, and how a release is made.

Also in the project root: [`CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md), what changed in
each version, and [`UPGRADING.md`](../UPGRADING.md), what to change in your
application when you upgrade.

## Glossary

The words these pages use, in plain terms, each linked to where it is explained
in full.

| Word | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Module** | A folder under `modules/` holding one part of your application: its pages, commands, tables and jobs. There are three kinds: `Shared` (exactly one, loaded first), `Plugins/<Name>` (your features) and `Gateways/<Name>` (usually a connection to an outside service, such as payments). See [Modules](reference/modules.md). |
| **`module.php`** | The one file that tells the framework what a module adds: its routes, commands, services, hooks and settings. See [Modules](reference/modules.md). |
| **Module id** | A module's name, taken from where its folder is: `modules/Plugins/Notes/` is `plugins/Notes`. |
| **Route** | A rule that connects a URL and an HTTP method, such as `GET /notes`, to the code that answers it. See [Routing](reference/routing.md). |
| **Handler** | The class or method a route calls. It receives the request, and returns a response, a string (HTML) or an array (JSON). See [Routing](reference/routing.md). |
| **Request, Response** | The framework's objects for what the browser sent and what goes back to it. |
| **Template** | A file that produces HTML, written in Twig (`.twig`) or PHP (`.php`). The site's templates live in `templates/`, and a module's in its `Templates/` folder. See [Templates](reference/templates.md). |
| **Twig** | The default template language. It escapes everything it prints, so text from a user cannot become HTML. |
| **Layout** | The template that holds what every page shares, such as the header and footer. `templates/layout.twig` is the default one. |
| **Asset** | A static file for the browser: a stylesheet, script or image. You link to one with `asset()`. See [Assets](reference/assets.md). |
| **Service** | An object your code needs, such as a repository. A module registers its services in `module.php`. |
| **Container** | The part of the framework that builds services and hands them to the classes that ask for them in their constructors. That handing-over is called *injection*. |
| **Model** | A class for one thing your application knows about, such as a note or an invoice, with the rules that keep it valid. It does not save itself. See [Models](reference/models.md). |
| **Repository** | The class that reads models from storage and saves them. You name its methods after what your application does, such as `latest()`. See [Repositories and queries](reference/data.md). |
| **Migration** | A file that creates or changes a database table. `php laika migrate` runs the ones that have not run yet. See [The database](reference/database.md). |
| **Command** | Something you run in a terminal, such as `php laika migrate`. A module can add its own. See [CLI](reference/console.md). |
| **Hook** | A named moment, such as `note.added`, that one module announces and other modules can react to. See [Hooks and filters](reference/hooks-and-filters.md). |
| **Filter** | A named value that other modules may change before it is used, such as a page title. See [Hooks and filters](reference/hooks-and-filters.md). |
| **Configuration** | Settings: the framework's defaults, then a module's defaults, then your files in `config/`, with environment variables where a file reads them. See [Configuration](reference/configuration.md). |
| **`.env`** | An optional file of environment variables for your own machine, such as a database password. It is never committed to git. See [Configuration](reference/configuration.md). |
| **Job, queue, worker** | A job is work to do later, such as sending an email. It waits in a queue until a worker process runs it. See [Queue and worker](reference/queue.md). |
| **Debug mode** | `APP_DEBUG=true`: errors show full details. Only for your own machine, never for a live site. |
