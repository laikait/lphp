# Sessions

A *session* is a small amount of data the application remembers about one
browser, between requests. Logins are built on it, and so are one-off messages
such as "Saved."

## Use a session

Type-hint `Session` and you get this request's:

```php
$routes->get('/visits', static function (Session $session): array {
    $visits = (int) $session->get('visits', 0) + 1;
    $session->set('visits', $visits);

    return ['visits' => $visits];
});
```

| Call | Does |
|---|---|
| `get($key, $default = null)` · `set($key, $value)` · `has()` · `forget()` | read and write |
| `flash($key, $value)` | keep it for this request and the next |
| `now($key, $value)` | this request only; stored nowhere |
| `regenerate()` | same data, new id — on login |
| `invalidate()` | no data, new id — on logout |
| `clear()` | discard everything stored |

**One thing to watch when injecting `Session`:** ask for it where the request
is — a closure route, a handler, a method parameter. A *singleton* service that
takes `Session` in its constructor holds the first request's session for the
life of a worker, and the symptom is users seeing each other's data.

**There is no `$_SESSION`, no `session_start()` and no global to reach for.** An
architecture test refuses all of them anywhere in the project. PHP's session
machinery keeps the data in a superglobal, the id in engine state and the policy
in ini settings, so a session cannot be built in a test, cannot be swapped for a
fake, and behaves differently depending on what the SAPI did before the script
ran. It also **holds a lock on the session for the whole request**, which is why
one slow endpoint blocks every other request from the same browser.

## Storage

| Store | Keeps sessions | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| `file` | one JSON file each, under `system/Sessions` | one machine. **The default** |
| `database` | a shared table | more than one machine — this is what "distributed sessions" means |
| `memory` | in memory | tests and the console only |

```bash
php laika migrate          # creates the table, while session.store is "database"
php laika session:gc       # delete what is past its lifetime
```

**A session payload must be JSON-serialisable**, and the memory store encodes
exactly like the others, so that "it worked in tests" means something.

PHP's own sessions `serialize()`, so an object dropped into one comes back as an
object — usually a stale copy of a row that changed an hour ago, occasionally a
class that no longer exists, which is a fatal error on a page nobody touched.
**Keep an id in the session and load the object from it.**

**File names are SHA-256 hashes, not ids.** A session id is a live credential:
whoever holds one is the user. A folder listing, a backup manifest or an `ls` in
a support ticket should not hand over an account, so the id appears only inside
the file, which needs read permission to reach.

### The database store

It takes a **row lock** through the query builder's `lockForUpdate()` —
`FOR UPDATE` on MySQL and PostgreSQL, `UPDLOCK` on SQL Server; SQLite locks the
whole database for a write — and runs on all four databases.

**It does not create its own table on a request.** A store that issues DDL on
its first request needs permissions in production that nothing should have, and
it uses them at the worst available moment.

Instead, while `session.store` is `database`, `php laika migrate` includes the
framework's own migration, `framework:2026_09_19_000000_create_sessions`, which
creates the table named by `session.table` (`sessions`). The key is the
64-character id, and both times are Unix seconds, with `touched_at` indexed for
the sweep. A table made earlier by hand is kept, and the migration is recorded
over it.

The table goes on the connection `migrate` runs on, so a `session.connection`
naming another database is migrated with `--connection` set to it.

## Two clocks

| Setting | Default | Means |
|---|---|---|
| `session.idle` | 2 hours | the one users feel: "it logged me out while I was at lunch" |
| `session.absolute` | off | a ceiling regardless of activity |

Without the second, a session that a background request keeps warm never expires
at all.

It is off by default because it is the setting most often switched on after an
incident rather than before one, and a framework that forced a value would have
to pick one that is wrong for both a kiosk and an internal tool.
`security:check` says out loud that there is not one. **Regenerating does not
reset the absolute clock.**

## Logging in and out

```php
$session->regenerate();   // same data, new id -- call this on login
$session->invalidate();   // no data, new id -- call this on logout
```

Changing the id is the defence against **session fixation**: an attacker who
planted an id in the victim's browser holds one that stopped meaning anything
the moment the user's privileges changed.

The naive version — write the new id, delete the old — breaks a page that logs
in with three fetches already in flight. Each arrives holding an id that no
longer exists, gets a brand new empty session, and **the user is logged out by
the act of logging in**.

So `regenerate()` leaves the old record as a *pointer* with no payload in it,
which a request inside `session.grace` seconds follows exactly **once**. Once,
not until it stops pointing: a chain would let one stale id walk through every
regeneration a session ever had. `invalidate()` leaves no pointer at all,
because a logout should not be followable.

Regenerating also **rotates the CSRF token**, through the `session.regenerated`
hook rather than a dependency. The security layer still does not know that
sessions exist, and an architecture test keeps it that way. A token issued to
the anonymous page that showed the login form must not stay valid against the
session the login created.

## Flash data is ordinary data

```php
$session->flash('status', 'Saved.');   // this request and the next
$session->now('status', 'Saved.');     // this request only, stored nowhere
$session->reflash();                   // keep it all for one more
$session->keep('status');              // keep some of it
```

Flashed values are ordinary keys, plus a list of names to delete one request
later, so reading one is just `get('status')`.

A separate flash bag with its own accessors would mean every template showing a
message has to know which kind of value it is holding.

## Sweeping

Expiry is decided **on read**, from the timestamps, so a sweep that has not run
for a week costs disk space and not correctness. `session:gc` reclaims it:

```php
$schedules->command('session:gc')->hourly();
```

A command rather than PHP's lottery, in which roughly one request in a hundred
pays for scanning the whole folder: the cost lands on a random user, at a random
moment, and most often on the busiest sites. (Worse, Debian-derived systems
switch the lottery off and replace it with a cron job, so a default
installation's behaviour depends on the distribution.)

## The cookie

`HttpOnly`, `SameSite=Lax`, `Secure` following the request scheme unless forced,
and it expires when the browser does.

**HttpOnly is not configurable**, and an architecture test refuses to let it
become so. This cookie *is* the credential, and a setting that exists is a
setting somebody switches off at four in the afternoon to make a widget work.
Everything else here is a judgement call somebody may reasonably need to make
differently.

`Lax` rather than `Strict` because Strict makes arriving from an email link or a
search result look logged out, and the usual fix for that is to turn the whole
thing off.

## If it doesn't work

| What you see | Why | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Users are logged out at random | Several machines, each with its own `file` store | `SESSION_STORE=database`, then `php laika migrate` |
| Logged out after exactly two hours | `session.idle` is 7200 seconds | Raise it |
| Two users see each other's data | A singleton service took `Session` in its constructor | Ask for it as a handler or method parameter |
| A stored object comes back as an array | Session data is JSON | Store an id and load the object |
| A flash message appears twice, or never | Flash data ages only on requests that touch the session | Usually right; check what else reads the session |
| `session:gc` deletes nothing | Expiry is on read; the sweep only reclaims space | Nothing to fix |

## Why it works this way

### Nothing is read until something asks

A request that never mentions the session does no storage read, no storage write
and sets no cookie.

That is not an optimisation. It is what keeps a JSON API from handing session
cookies to clients that will never send them back — and it fixes a bug people
usually live with, because **flash data ages only on requests that touch the
session**. A background poll no longer eats the message meant for the next page
the user opens.

### The request writes what it changed, not what it read

A browser makes several requests at once — a page and three fetches — and all of
them carry the same session. PHP's answer is to lock it for the whole request.
The usual alternative is to read at the start, write the whole array at the end,
and quietly lose whichever request finished first.

Here `Session` records a **change log**, and `SessionStore::commit()` takes a
closure that the store applies to whatever is stored *now*, under its own lock:

```php
public function commit(string $id, \Closure $apply): ?SessionRecord;
```

Two concurrent requests, one setting `cart` and one setting `locale`, both
survive. Two requests writing the *same* key still resolve to the last writer,
which is inherent: there is no answer to "both of us set it" that a session layer
can pick for you. The lock covers a read-modify-write of one record, so it is
measured in microseconds rather than in the length of a request.

`clear()` is the one operation that is not per-key: it discards whatever is
stored, rather than unsetting the keys this request happened to read. Since
`invalidate()` is built on it, the alternative would be a logout that leaves data
behind.
