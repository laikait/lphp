# Observability

The specification's §52 lists what a heavy backend eventually needs to be
diagnosed — request id, correlation id, execution, query, module, hook and filter
timing, memory, error context — and then gives the instruction that shaped all
of this: *"Do not build a giant debug dashboard initially. First build reliable
instrumentation APIs."* So there is no dashboard, no page and no store. What is
observed leaves through two channels every deployment already has: **the log**,
and **response headers**. An architecture test holds `engine/Observability/` to
that — nothing in it opens a file, prints or sets a header on its own.

It comes in two halves, deliberately different.

## Always on: which unit of work is this?

Every request, console command and job runs inside a **trace**. A trace has an
id of its own and a **correlation id** naming the thing that started the chain:

```
POST /invoices/run          request   id 6aa97a..e1   correlation 6aa97a..e1
  └ queues InvoiceRun
      job (a worker, later)  job       id 6aa97b..07   correlation 6aa97a..e1
        └ queues SendInvoice
            job              job       id 6aa97b..3c   correlation 6aa97a..e1
```

The correlation travels inside the queued job's envelope, so *"what did that
click cause"* is one search of the log, across the queue boundary where a request
id alone stops. Nobody passes an id along by hand.

What that buys, with nothing configured:

- **Every response carries `X-Request-Id`** — assets, 404s and error pages
  included. It is what a user quotes to support.
- **Every log record carries `trace`, `request_id` and `correlation_id`.** The log
  manager adds them underneath the record's own context, so a worker logging
  about some other job can still say which one it means.
- **Error records say what the request was** — method and path — beside the id
  the client was given. Not the query string and not the body: that is where a
  token is, and an error log is read by more people than the request was.

Ids are 24 hex characters, sortable by time. **An id from outside is ignored**
unless `observability.trust_incoming_ids` is on — which is right behind a gateway
that stamps `X-Request-Id` and `X-Correlation-Id`, so its log and this one agree,
and wrong otherwise, because a client should not choose the id its own requests
are logged under. A trusted id is still checked against a pattern before it is
used, because a newline in it would let a client write a log line of its own.

```php
public function __construct(private readonly Tracer $tracer) {}

$this->tracer->current()->id;                 // this request, command or job
$this->tracer->current()->correlationId;      // the chain it belongs to
$this->tracer->current()->elapsedMilliseconds();
$this->tracer->current()->memoryGrowth();     // bytes, since the unit of work began
```

## Off unless asked for: where did the time go?

```bash
APP_PROFILE=true
```

The **profiler** times every hook listener, every filter listener, every module
stage — discover, resolve and register as totals; load and boot per module,
because those run a module's own code — and every database statement. At the end
of each request, command and job it writes one record to the `profile` log
channel:

```
INFO [profile] GET /customers.json 200 in 17.53 ms {"request_id":"6aa979e8...",
  "elapsed_ms":17.547,"memory_growth_kb":1284.6,"memory_peak_mb":6,
  "categories":{"module":{"count":9,"ms":10.523},"filter":{"count":5,"ms":0.277},...},
  "slowest":{"module":[{"name":"register","detail":null,"ms":4.397},
                       {"name":"boot","detail":"plugins/Example","ms":1.72},...],
             "hook":[{"name":"request.received","detail":"engine App\\Engine\\Security\\Guard::onRequest",...}]}}
```

With `APP_DEBUG` on as well, the same numbers go out as a `Server-Timing`
header, which a browser's developer tools already draw as a waterfall:

```
Server-Timing: app;dur=19.03, module;dur=10.52;desc="9", filter;dur=0.28;desc="5", hook;dur=0.03;desc="5"
```

Only in debug, because it is an exact description of where a request spends its
time — not something to hand every client of a production system. The log gets it
either way.

Things worth knowing about the numbers:

- **They are aggregated, not a list of events.** A page fires thousands of filter
  listeners; each measurement is folded into a count, a total and a maximum under
  its name, and the number of names kept per category is capped. A worker running
  for hours holds the same amount. The count is also the answer to N+1: *the same
  statement fifty times* is one line with `"count":50`.
- **They are inclusive.** A hook listener that applies a filter counts the filter's
  time as its own, and the filter counts it too. Categories answer "how long was
  spent inside hooks" and "inside queries" separately; they do not add up to the
  request.
- **Queries are named by their SQL, never their values.** The connection's
  observation seam does not pass the bindings at all — a test checks the observer
  receives exactly three arguments — because a bound value is where a password or
  a card number is, and a profile is exactly the output that gets pasted into a
  ticket.
- **Listeners are named for what they are**: `Guard::onRequest` for a method,
  `closure at Bootstrap.php:577` for a closure.

Application code can time its own work under its own names:

```php
$profiler->measure('billing', 'invoice run', fn () => $run->execute());
```

With profiling off that is a function call and nothing else.

## How "off" costs nothing

The subsystems being measured do not know the profiler exists. `HookEngine`,
`FilterEngine`, `ModuleManager` and `Connection` each expose one `observe()` seam
— a closure told what ran and for how long — and the profiler is the only thing
that attaches to them, from the bootstrap. With profiling off nothing is attached,
so a hook firing pays for a null check rather than a clock. The benchmark suite
shows it: a hook with ten listeners costs 2.0 µs unobserved, as it did before the
seam existed, and 15.6 µs profiled. That difference is why it is off by default.

Two architecture tests keep this true: **no subsystem references the profiler**
(add a check for "is profiling on" inside `HookEngine` and the build fails), and
**every `observe()` seam is connected**, so a subsystem cannot quietly drop out of
every profile.

## Slow queries, profiling or not

```bash
SLOW_QUERY_MS=250
```

Any statement slower than this is a warning on the `database` channel, with its
SQL and its duration and never its values. It is the one timing worth paying for
on every statement in production: a query that took four seconds is a fact nobody
should have to reproduce to learn about.

| Key | Default | |
|---|---|---|
| `observability.profile` | `false` (`APP_PROFILE`) | Attach the profiler. Leave it off; switch it on to find out where a slow page goes. |
| `observability.slow_query_ms` | `0` (`SLOW_QUERY_MS`) | Warn about statements slower than this. `0` is off. |
| `observability.trust_incoming_ids` | `false` | Use `X-Request-Id` / `X-Correlation-Id` from the request. Only behind something that sets them. |

`php laika about` says which of these is on.
