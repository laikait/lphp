# CLI

`php laika <command>` runs a console command. The console boots the same
application HTTP does — same container, same modules, same hooks — so a command
can use everything a page can.

This page covers writing a command, how input is parsed, what the exit codes
mean, and the commands the framework ships with.

## Write a command

A command is an ordinary class. Nothing to extend, nothing to implement:

```php
final class SyncCustomers
{
    public function __construct(private readonly CustomerQuery $customers) {}

    public function __invoke(Output $output, string $since, int $limit, bool $dryRun): int
    {
        $output->line('Syncing since ' . $since);

        return 0;
    }
}
```

Then declare it in `module.php`, next to your routes:

```php
$module->commands(static function (CommandCollector $commands): void {
    $commands->add('customer:sync', SyncCustomers::class)
        ->describe('Pull customer records from the upstream system.')
        ->argument('since', 'Only records changed on or after this date.', required: false, default: 'yesterday')
        ->option('limit', 'Stop after this many records.', shortcut: 'l', default: '25')
        ->flag('dry-run', 'Report what would change without writing anything.', shortcut: 'd');
});
```

| Declares | Looks like on the command line |
|---|---|
| `argument('since', …)` | `php laika customer:sync 2026-01-01` |
| `option('limit', …, shortcut: 'l')` | `--limit=5`, `--limit 5`, `-l 5`, `-l5` |
| `flag('dry-run', …, shortcut: 'd')` | `--dry-run`, `-d`, and it is a `bool` |

Nothing is scanned. A `Commands/` folder is where these classes happen to live,
not how they are found. A file's mere existence should not change what an
application does, and what a module contributes stays readable in one file.

The handler takes the same three forms a route handler does:

```php
$commands->add('customer:sync', SyncCustomers::class);              // invokable class
$commands->add('customer:show', [ShowCustomer::class, 'show']);     // [class, method]
$commands->add('customer:count', static fn (CustomerQuery $c): string => …);  // closure
```

## How input reaches your parameters

```bash
php laika customer:sync 2026-01-01 --dry-run --limit=5
php laika customer:sync 2026-01-01 -dl5      # the same thing
```

Two rules:

- **What you declared arrives by name.** `since`, `limit` and `dry-run` become
  `$since`, `$limit` and `$dryRun`.
- **Anything with a class type arrives from the container, by type.** So a
  command that declares an argument called `output` still gets a real `Output`.

A dash is not legal in a PHP parameter name, so `--dry-run` binds to `$dryRun`.
That rename is mechanical, one-way, and applies only to names containing a dash.

Values are converted the same way route parameters are, so `"1"` means the same
thing on the command line as it does in a URL, and `--times=lots` for an
`int $times` is a usage error printed with the synopsis, not a `TypeError`.

What the parser accepts, and what it refuses:

| Written | Result |
|---|---|
| `--flag`, `--limit=50`, `--limit 50` | declared options |
| `-l 50`, `-l50`, `-abc` | shortcut, attached value, bundled flags |
| `--` | everything after it is positional |
| `--lim` for `--limit` | **refused** |
| `--limit --dry-run` | **refused** |

**Abbreviation is refused** because the abbreviation that is unique today
becomes ambiguous the day somebody adds an option, and a script written against
it breaks at a distance. For the same reason a suggested name is never run in
place of what you typed: a typo gets `Did you mean "customer:sync"?` and exit
127, so a command that deletes something is never reachable by a name its author
did not write.

**`--limit --dry-run` is refused** because reading `--dry-run` as the value would
hide a forgotten argument behind a nonsensical limit, and the run would look
like it worked.

## What to return, and what a shell sees

Return an `int` for the exit code, a `string` to print, or nothing for success.

**A `bool` is refused.** PHP's convention says `true` is success; the shell's
says `0` is. An exit code that gets it backwards turns a failed job into a green
tick.

| Code | Means |
|---|---|
| `0` | it worked |
| `1` | it ran and failed, or something threw |
| `2` | the command line was wrong — missing argument, unknown option |
| `127` | no such command |

The 2-versus-127 split earns its keep: a deployment script that mistypes a
command name and one that forgets an argument are different bugs, and a wrapper
that retries on one should not retry on the other.

Results go to standard output and complaints go to standard error, so
`laika route:list | grep customers` carries no warnings, and
`laika customer:sync 2>errors.log` separates the two.

## Help is generated

There is no second description of the interface to fall out of date:

```
$ php laika customer:sync --help
Usage:
  php laika customer:sync [since] [options]

Arguments:
  since  Only records changed on or after this date. (default: yesterday)

Options:
  -l, --limit=<value>  Stop after this many records. (default: 25)
  -d, --dry-run        Report what would change without writing anything.

Declared by module Example.
```

`php laika help` lists everything; `php laika help <name>` explains one.

## The framework's own commands are not special

Every one of these is registered through the same `CommandCollector` your module
uses, under the module name `engine`. The kernel has no idea they exist: delete
`CoreCommands` and the console still works, with fewer commands.

**Getting your bearings**

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `about` | Summarise this application: version, modules, routes, connections. |
| `help` | List the available commands, or explain one of them. |
| `module:list` | Discovered modules, in the order they load. |
| `route:list` | Every registered route and its owning module. |
| `asset:list` | Every published asset folder and the URL prefix it answers on. |
| `template:list` | The template search path, highest precedence first. |
| `config:list` | The configuration this process actually resolved to. |
| `system:info` | The operating system, kernel, memory, disk and load of this machine. |

**Databases**

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `migrate` | Run every module's pending migrations, in module order, as one batch. |
| `migrate:status` | Every migration, whether it ran, and in which batch. |
| `migrate:rollback` | Undo the last batch of migrations, newest first. |
| `db:seed` | Run every module's seeders, in module order, or one module's. |

**Caches**

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `cache:clear` | Delete the configuration, module, template and application caches. |
| `cache:warm` | Build the production boot path: the configuration and discovery caches. |
| `config:cache` | Compile `config/` and the defaults into one cached file. |

**Background work**

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `queue:work` | Run queued jobs until told to stop. |
| `queue:status` | What is waiting on each queue, and what has failed. |
| `queue:failed` | The jobs that gave up; retry or discard them. |
| `schedule:run` | Run whatever is due this minute. This is what cron calls. |
| `schedule:list` | Every scheduled task, when it next runs, and what is running now. |
| `schedule:unlock` | Release a schedule lock held after a machine died mid-run. |

**Security and accounts**

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `security:check` | Audit what this deployment actually has switched on. |
| `security:key` | Print a new `APP_KEY`. |
| `auth:access` | Every capability, every role, and which routes check them. |
| `auth:hash` | Hash a password, for seeding the first account. |
| `session:gc` | Delete sessions past their lifetime. |

**Running a server**

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `nginx:make` | Write the nginx server block for this application to `nginx.conf`. |
| `log:status` | Where records go, and whether they are getting there. |
| `system:cron:install` | Install the crontab line that runs `schedule:run` every minute. |
| `system:cron:list` | The jobs this application owns in the crontab. |
| `system:cron:remove` | Remove this application's crontab jobs. |
| `system:service:status` | Whether a systemd service is running. |
| `system:service:restart` | Restart a service that `system.services` allows restarting. |

**MCP**

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `mcp:list` | Every MCP tool, resource and prompt, its module and who may use it. |
| `mcp:stdio` | Serve MCP over stdin and stdout, as a user, for a local client. |

**None of them generates code**, and an architecture test pins that list.
`nginx:make` writes a file, but it is web server configuration that nothing in
the framework reads.

A `make:something` command writes a file whose shape the framework then quietly
depends on, and that shape is undocumented because the generator *is* the
documentation. It is how a framework stops being a library you call and becomes
a thing you live inside.

## If it doesn't work

| What you see | Why | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `Did you mean …?` and exit 127 | The command name is wrong; nothing was run | Type the full name |
| Exit 2 with a synopsis | A missing argument, an unknown option, or a value of the wrong type | The message names it |
| `--lim` is not accepted | Abbreviations are refused on purpose | Write the option in full |
| A new command is missing | A module cache from `cache:warm` is in use | `php laika cache:clear` |
| An error says only "Set APP_DEBUG=1…" | The message was withheld, as it is on the web | Rerun with `APP_DEBUG=1 php laika …` |

## Why it works this way

### No `Command` base class

An architecture test asserts that nothing under `engine/Cli/` is abstract, is an
interface, or has a protected member — because a base class is how a command
stops being an ordinary object. It arrives with `$this->argument()`, then
`$this->output`, then `$this->info()`, and after that a module's command can
only be written one way.

`ConsoleKernel` and `HttpKernel` read as mirror images because they do the same
job: look a name up in a registry, parse input against what was declared, call a
handler through the container, and turn the result into something the caller
understands.

### Declarations, not a signature string

`"{user : the id} {--queue=}"` is a small language embedded in a docblock:
invisible to static analysis, and checked only when somebody runs it. A method
call per argument is longer to write, is checked by your editor as you write it,
and generates the help from the same declaration.

### Errors on a terminal

`command.matched`, `command.finished` and `command.failed` are the CLI's
lifecycle hooks. There is deliberately **no filter over parsed input**: a filter
carries a value so a module can change it, and a module silently rewriting
another module's arguments is worse than the flexibility is worth.

An exception's message obeys the same rule the web does — an `HttpException`
message is written by this framework and survives, anything else is replaced
outside debug mode. The console was the one place that did not, and a
`DatabaseException` carrying `dsn=…` into a cron log is exactly what that rule
exists to prevent.

What the console adds is a way forward: when a message is withheld it says
`Set APP_DEBUG=1 for the full message and a stack trace`, because the person
reading a console error is the person who can turn debug on.
