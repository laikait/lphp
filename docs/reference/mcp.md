# MCP

```php
$module->mcp(static function (McpCollector $mcp): void {
    $mcp->tool('invoice.void', VoidInvoice::class, 'Void an unpaid invoice.', permission: 'invoice.void');
});
```

The framework serves [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)
tools, resources and prompts that modules declare, over STDIO for a local
client and over HTTP for a remote one. MCP is **an interface to what your
modules already do**, just as a route or a console command is. It holds no
business logic and exposes nothing a module has not named: there is no generic
query tool, no filesystem browser, no shell and no way to reach a class by
name.

Module-facing classes are **Experimental**; the server, registry and transports
are Internal. See [`STABILITY.md`](../../STABILITY.md).

## How it fits together

```text
module.php ──$module->mcp()──► McpRegistry      (name → handler class, owning module, permission)

stdin/stdout ─► StdioTransport ┐
POST /mcp ────► HttpTransport ─┴► McpServer ─► ToolRunner / ResourceReader / PromptProvider
                                                 │  authorize → mcp.tool.input → validate
                                                 │  → mcp.tool.before → your class → output filter
                                                 └► your module's service, which does the work
```

- **A transport** decides who is calling. The STDIO user is chosen by whoever
  starts the process; over HTTP it is the bearer token's owner. It also turns
  bytes into messages. Nothing a client sends can change the identity.
- **The server** speaks the protocol: `initialize`, `ping`, `tools/*`,
  `resources/*` and `prompts/*`.
- **The runners** resolve a registered name to its class, authorize, validate,
  call it and shape the result.
- **Your class** is thin. It asks a service your module already has, the same
  service a route or a job would call.

## A complete example

A module offering one read-only tool, one resource and one prompt.

```php
// modules/Plugins/Invoices/module.php
return static function (ModuleContext $module): void {
    $module->name('Invoices');

    $module->access(static function (AccessCollector $access): void {
        $access->capability('invoice.read', 'See invoices.');
        $access->role('accountant', ['invoice.read']);
    });

    $module->mcp(static function (McpCollector $mcp): void {
        $mcp->tool('invoice.find', FindInvoice::class, 'Find an invoice by its number.', permission: 'invoice.read')
            ->resource('invoice://{number}', InvoiceResource::class, 'One invoice, as JSON.', permission: 'invoice.read')
            ->prompt('invoice.chase', ChaseLetter::class, 'Draft a reminder for an overdue invoice.');
    });
};
```

```php
final class FindInvoice implements Tool
{
    public function __construct(private readonly InvoiceService $invoices) {}

    public function inputSchema(): array
    {
        return [
            'type' => 'object',
            'properties' => ['number' => ['type' => 'string', 'pattern' => '^INV-[0-9]{1,10}$']],
            'required' => ['number'],
        ];
    }

    public function call(array $arguments, McpContext $context): ToolResult
    {
        $invoice = $this->invoices->find($arguments['number'], $context->identity);

        return $invoice === null
            ? ToolResult::error('No invoice has that number.')
            : ToolResult::structured(['number' => $invoice->number, 'total' => $invoice->total, 'status' => $invoice->status]);
    }
}
```

`tests/Fixtures/Modules/McpDemo/Plugins/McpDemo/` is a working module with one
of each kind, plus a hook and a filter. `tests/Feature/McpDemoModuleTest` drives
it over both transports. `tests/Fixtures/Modules/System/Plugins/Server/` shows
[system operations](system.md#who-may-ask) as MCP tools.

## Declaring capabilities

Declare inside `$module->mcp()` while `module.php` loads. A capability cannot
be added later.

| Kind | Declared as | Name |
|---|---|---|
| Tool | `->tool(name, Handler::class, description, permission: ?)` | `a-z`, digits, `.`, `_`, `-`; up to 128 characters, starting with a letter |
| Resource | `->resource(uri, Handler::class, description, permission: ?)` | an absolute URI such as `status://app`, or a template such as `invoice://{number}` |
| Prompt | `->prompt(name, Handler::class, description, permission: ?)` | as for a tool |

- The handler is built by the container, so it takes its services in its
  constructor.
- A name is claimed by one module only. A duplicate stops boot, and the error
  names both modules.
- A **disabled module offers nothing**: its capabilities are never registered.
- `php laika mcp:list [--module=plugins/Invoices]` shows every capability,
  its module, what a caller needs, and how each transport is configured.

## Permissions

A permission is an ordinary [auth capability](auth.md), declared by the module
that checks it and granted by roles.

- **Anything that reads private data or changes something must name one.** A
  capability with no permission is open to any signed-in user; `mcp:list`
  shows it as "any user".
- **A caller without the permission cannot tell the capability exists.** It is
  not listed, and calling it answers exactly as calling a name that does not
  exist. The refusal is logged as a warning for you, not reported to the client.
- **Guests are refused everything** unless `mcp.allow_guests` is true. Even
  then, a guest can use only capabilities that name no permission.
- The permission is the first check, not the only one. Your service still
  decides about the specific record. "May read invoices" is not "may read
  *this* invoice", so pass `$context->identity` through, as `FindInvoice`
  does.

## Writing a tool

`Tool` has two methods: `inputSchema(): array` and
`call(array $arguments, McpContext $context): ToolResult`.

```php
ToolResult::text('Invoice INV-42 was voided.');
ToolResult::structured(['number' => 'INV-42', 'status' => 'void'], 'Voided INV-42.');
ToolResult::error('INV-42 is already paid and cannot be voided.');
```

- `structured()` takes **plain data only**: scalars, null and arrays of them.
  A model or any other object is refused, because what an object serialises to
  is whatever its properties happen to be. Build the array you mean to send.
- `error()` is for failures worth telling the model, which may try something
  else. Throw an `McpException` (such as `ToolException`) only to refuse in
  protocol terms.
- **Any other exception** is reported to the error log with the request id, and
  the client gets "The tool failed." Its message never reaches the client,
  because that is exactly where a SQL fragment or a path would be.
- The arguments you receive have already been checked against your schema and
  normalized: defaults are filled in, and `7.0` becomes `7`.

### Input schemas

A strict subset of JSON Schema, and it **fails closed**. A keyword it does not
support is an error when the tool is used, not ignored.

| Supported | |
|---|---|
| `type` | `object`, `string`, `integer`, `number`, `boolean`, `array`, `null` |
| objects | `properties`, `required`, `additionalProperties` (boolean) |
| arrays | `items`, `minItems`, `maxItems` |
| values | `enum`, `const`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern` (PCRE, UTF-8), `minimum`, `maximum` |
| annotations | `default`, `description`, `title` |

A property you did not list is **refused** unless `additionalProperties` is
`true`, and a tool whose schema is just `{"type": "object"}` accepts no
arguments at all. Arguments are limited to 256 KiB and 32 levels of nesting.
A validation failure answers `InvalidParams` with up to ten `{path, message}`
problems, and never echoes the offending value.

For an operation that changes something important, ask the model to confirm in
the call itself: `'confirm' => ['type' => 'boolean', 'const' => true]`. This is
not security (the permission is), but a client that shows tool calls shows the
confirmation.

## Writing a resource

```php
final class InvoiceResource implements Resource
{
    public function __construct(private readonly InvoiceService $invoices) {}

    public function read(string $uri, array $parameters, McpContext $context): ResourceContents
    {
        $invoice = $this->invoices->find($parameters['number'], $context->identity)
            ?? throw ResourceException::notFound($uri);

        return ResourceContents::json($uri, ['number' => $invoice->number, 'total' => $invoice->total]);
    }
}
```

`ResourceContents::text($uri, $text, $mimeType)`, `::json($uri, $data)` and
`::blob($uri, $bytes, $mimeType)`. A URI without placeholders is listed by
`resources/list`; a template is listed by `resources/templates/list`.

**A placeholder matches one path segment of printable text.** Before your class
runs, it is URL-decoded and then refused if it contains a `/` or a control
character. So `invoice://..%2F..%2Fetc` never reaches you, but it is still the
client's text: look it up, never use it as a path.

## Writing a prompt

```php
final class ChaseLetter implements Prompt
{
    public function arguments(): array
    {
        return [new PromptArgument('number', 'The invoice number.', required: true)];
    }

    public function get(array $arguments, McpContext $context): PromptResult
    {
        return new PromptResult([
            PromptMessage::user(\sprintf('Draft a polite reminder for invoice %s.', $arguments['number'])),
        ], 'Reminder for an overdue invoice');
    }
}
```

Arguments are strings. A missing required argument, or one the prompt does not
declare, is refused before `get()` runs.

## Configuration

`config/mcp.php` returns the `mcp` block. Every key is optional:

```php
return [
    'enabled' => true,
    'server' => ['name' => 'Acme ERP', 'version' => '4.2.0'],
    'transports' => ['stdio' => true, 'http' => true],
    'http' => ['path' => '/mcp'],
    'allow_guests' => false,
];
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `true` | The switch for all of MCP. When it is off, `mcp:stdio` refuses to start and the HTTP path returns 404 |
| `server.name`, `server.version` | `lphp`, the framework version | What `initialize` reports to a client. One line, 1–100 characters |
| `transports.stdio` | `true` | Whether `mcp:stdio` will serve. On its own this opens nothing |
| `transports.http` | `false` | Whether the HTTP endpoint exists |
| `http.path` | `/mcp` | The endpoint's exact path. Surrounding slashes are ignored. A query, fragment, `..`, percent-escape or bare `/` is refused |
| `allow_guests` | `false` | Whether a caller with no credentials is served as a guest, or refused |
| `log.enabled` | `true` | Whether the `mcp` log channel records MCP traffic (see [Logging](#logging)) |

Every value is checked when MCP is first used, and a wrong one raises a
`ConfigurationException` that names the key. The HTTP endpoint needs its
settings on every request, so an invalid `mcp` block fails every request until
it is fixed, just as a malformed security key does.

## STDIO

```sh
php laika mcp:stdio --user=ada
```

The MCP client starts this command and talks to it over the pipe. Most clients
take the command as JSON:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "acme": { "command": "php", "args": ["/srv/app/laika", "mcp:stdio", "--user=ada"] } } }
```

- **The session acts as the named user for its whole life.** The user is looked
  up by login, then by id. An unknown or inactive account is refused with a
  message that does not say which. Without `--user`, the session is a guest.
  Whoever can run the console chooses the user; that is the same trust as
  running any other command.
- **stdout carries only protocol messages.** Anything a handler prints is
  discarded and reported on stderr as a byte count.
- A line longer than 1 MiB is skipped whole and answered as an invalid request.
  The process exits when the client closes stdin.

## HTTP

Once `mcp.transports.http` is on, the endpoint takes one JSON-RPC message per
`POST` to `mcp.http.path`. It is not a route. The kernel answers it before
routing, as it does for assets, so route meta, CSRF and the route guard do not
apply to it. The request size limit, the security headers and
`response.instance` still run.

- **Bearer tokens only.** The session cookie is never consulted, because the
  browser attaches it on its own. Tokens come from the application's
  `TokenProvider`, as [for REST](auth.md). A request with no valid token gets
  `401` with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer realm="mcp"`. A token that is sent and
  rejected is never downgraded to a guest, and a token in the query string is
  ignored.
- **Same-origin browsers only.** A request whose `Origin` header names another
  scheme, host or port gets `403`, which blocks DNS rebinding. Clients that are
  not browsers send no `Origin` and are unaffected.
- **Stateless.** There is no `Mcp-Session-Id` and no event stream. Each request
  stands alone at the version in `MCP-Protocol-Version` (2025-03-26 when the
  header is absent). `initialize` is still answered.

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| 200 | A request was answered. This includes a JSON-RPC error about the request, such as an unknown tool |
| 202 | A notification: accepted, with no body |
| 400 | Unreadable JSON, an invalid message or batch, a message over 1 MiB, or an unsupported protocol version |
| 401 | No valid bearer token, and guests are not allowed |
| 403 | The `Origin` header names another site |
| 405 | Any method but `POST` (`Allow: POST`) |
| 406 | `Accept` excludes `application/json` |
| 415 | The body is not `application/json` |

Every refusal still carries a JSON-RPC error, with a null `id`. Apache does not
pass the `Authorization` header to PHP on its own. `public/.htaccess` has the
rule that does, so keep it if you replace that file.

## Logging

MCP traffic is written to the `mcp` log channel, so you can route it to its own
destination by channel name. Every record carries the MCP request id,
transport, client, principal (a user id, or null for a guest), capability, kind
and owning module.

| Level | Record |
|---|---|
| warning | Access denied: authorization refused a capability. The client was told it does not exist |
| warning | A capability failed. The record holds the exception class only; the exception itself goes to the error log |
| notice | A capability refused in protocol terms |
| info | A tool called (with `ms`), a resource read (with its URI), a prompt loaded, a request that failed (with the JSON-RPC code) |
| debug | Every request, with its method |

Arguments, results, resource contents and prompt text are **never** logged,
because that is where a customer's data or a secret would be. The logging
layer's own redaction (`logging.redact`) still applies to what is logged. Set
`mcp.log.enabled` to `false` to stop these records; the hooks keep firing for
any other listener.

## Hooks and filters

The `mcp.*` hooks and filters are listed in the
[lifecycle table](hooks-and-filters.md#lifecycle-extension-points). Register
them from `onBoot`, as for any other hook:

```php
$module->onBoot(static function (HookEngine $hooks): void {
    $hooks->add('mcp.tool.after', static function (Capability $tool, ToolResult $result, McpContext $context): void {
        // count, audit, notify
    }, 10, 'plugins/Invoices');
});
```

They never run ahead of the security checks. A capability the caller may not
use reaches no listener. `mcp.tool.input` runs **before** schema validation, so
a filter cannot add input that the schema forbids. An output filter must return
the same kind of value it was given, or the call fails and is reported. A
listener can refuse a call by throwing an MCP exception, but it cannot grant
access to anything.

## Security

These hold for every capability, and each has a test (`tests/Feature/McpSecurityTest`
and the architecture tests):

- **Only registered names resolve.** Class names, `Class::method` strings,
  function names and near misses are all "Unknown tool.", and nothing is
  attempted.
- **MCP itself reaches no infrastructure.** `engine/MCP` imports no database,
  model or system code and calls no file or process function. What a tool can
  do is exactly what your service does.
- **Every refusal is indistinguishable from absence.** The log tells you the
  truth; the client learns nothing.
- **Nothing a handler throws reaches the client**, even with `app.debug` on.
- **Input is bounded.** Messages are limited to 1 MiB, JSON nesting to 64
  levels, arguments to 256 KiB and 32 levels, and an echoed unknown name to 128
  characters.

What remains yours: choose permissions, check the specific record in your
service, give tools names that say what they do, and prefer read-only tools. A
tool that changes something deserves a `confirm` argument and a narrow
permission.

## In production

There is **no manifest to build**. Capabilities are declared in `module.php`,
which runs on every boot anyway, as routes are. The module discovery cache that
`cache:warm` writes already removes the filesystem scan, and registering a
hundred capabilities takes about 0.15 ms (`composer bench`). What `mcp:list`
shows is exactly what is served.

An MCP call over HTTP costs less than an ordinary JSON request, and a page
request with MCP enabled builds nothing of MCP.

## Testing

Call the server the application built, as a client would:

```php
$app = $this->application(['modules' => ['paths' => ['plugins' => 'modules/Plugins']]])->boot();

$session = new McpSession(new Identity('7', 'ada', ['accountant']), 'stdio');
$session->initialize('2025-06-18', 'test', '1');

$answer = $app->container()->get(McpServer::class)->handle(
    '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"invoice.find","arguments":{"number":"INV-42"}}}',
    $session,
);
```

Over HTTP, enable the transport in the test's configuration and `handle()` a
`POST /mcp` with a bearer token, as `tests/Feature/McpHttpSliceTest` does. Test
the refusals as well as the answers: a caller without the permission, a guest,
and input the schema refuses.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause |
|---|---|
| The client sees no tools | The user lacks every permission, or is a guest. `mcp:list` shows what each tool needs |
| "Unknown tool." for a tool that exists | The caller lacks its permission, or its module is disabled. Look for a `denied` warning in the `mcp` log |
| `POST /mcp` is 404 | `mcp.transports.http` is off, or `mcp.enabled` is false, or the path differs from `mcp.http.path` |
| Every request is 401 | No token was sent, or the `Authorization` header is stripped before PHP (Apache without the passthrough), or the application's user provider does not implement `TokenProvider` |
| 403 from a browser-based client | Its `Origin` is not this server's scheme, host and port |
| The STDIO client says it received invalid JSON | Something wrote to stdout outside a handler, such as a `module.php` that echoes. Handler output is caught and reported on stderr |
| "The tool failed." | The handler threw. The exception is in the error log, and the `mcp` log's warning at the same moment names the tool and the exception class |
| A `ConfigurationException` on every request | The `mcp` block is invalid; the message names the key |
