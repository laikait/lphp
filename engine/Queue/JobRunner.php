/**
 * Runs one job, and announces that it did.
 *
 * Small on purpose, and shared by the two things that run jobs: a Worker
 * draining a queue, and the sync store running one where it was dispatched.
 * Neither gets its own idea of what "running a job" means, so a hook fires
 * identically whether or not an application has a worker.
 *
 * The job's handle() is called through the container, which is where its
 * arguments come from. That is the same mechanism a route handler, a console
 * command and a module's onBoot use -- there is one way to be given your
 * collaborators in this framework, and this is it.
 *
 * Exceptions are not caught here. What to do about a failure is a policy
 * question with completely different answers for a worker (retry, back off,
 * eventually record it) and for a synchronous dispatch (there is no later; the
 * caller gets the exception). This does the part they agree on.
