 * The queue refused something, or could not read something back.
 *
 * Everything here happens at one of two moments: dispatching a job that cannot
 * work, which is caught in development the first time the line runs, or reading
 * a payload that no longer describes a class, which is what a deployment that
 * renamed a job looks like from a worker's point of view.
 *
 * A job that throws while running is not one of these. That is the
 * application's exception, and the worker's job is to retry it and eventually
 * record it, not to convert it into something else.
