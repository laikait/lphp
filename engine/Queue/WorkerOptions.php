/**
 * How a worker should behave on this run.
 *
 * A value object rather than eight parameters, because the answers come from
 * three places -- configuration, the command line, and a test -- and threading
 * eight arguments through all three is how two of them end up disagreeing about
 * the default.
 *
 * The limits deserve a word. A worker that runs forever is a worker whose
 * memory only goes up, whose code is whatever was deployed when it started, and
 * which nobody notices has been holding a stale database connection since
 * Tuesday. Bounded runs are the standard answer: the process does a decent
 * amount of work, exits cleanly, and whatever supervises it starts another with
 * the current code. --max-jobs and --max-time are how that is said here.
