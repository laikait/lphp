 * helper, for the same reason there is no Cache::get(): a class that queues
 * work has a dependency, and a dependency belongs in a constructor where a test
 * can replace it with a memory store and then read what was queued.
 *
 * This is the half with the behaviour -- naming, serialising, hooks -- and
 * QueueStore is the half with the storage. What that split buys is the sync
 * store: "run it now" is a store like any other, so nothing in an application
 * changes between a development machine with no worker and a server with four.
 *
 * Two refusals happen at dispatch rather than in a worker, because both are
 * mistakes in the line being written and neither should be discovered an hour
 * later by whoever reads the failed list: a job with no handle(), and a job
 * that cannot be serialised.
