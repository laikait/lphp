/**
 * A job on a queue: the work, plus everything the queue knows about it.
 *
 * The envelope is separate from the job because the two have different owners.
 * A job knows about invoices; this knows about attempts, reservations and when
 * it may next be tried, none of which is the application's business and all of
 * which a worker needs.
 *
 * It carries the class name next to the payload so that queue:status and
 * queue:failed can say what a job is without unserialising it. Reading a failed
 * job's payload means instantiating a class from a store, and a listing command
 * should not have to do that to print a line.
 *
 * Every change hands back a new envelope. A queue is a place where two
 * processes look at the same work, and a value that cannot be edited in place
 * is one fewer way for them to disagree.
