/**
 * The loop that takes jobs off a queue and runs them.
 *
 * Reserve, run, acknowledge. When the job throws: put it back with a delay, or,
 * once it has had its attempts, record it as failed. That is the whole worker,
 * and everything interesting about it is in what happens when something goes
 * wrong.
 *
 * **A crashed worker loses nothing.** A reservation expires, and an expired
 * reservation is available again -- so a worker that is killed mid-job costs
 * one retry rather than one lost job. This is also why there is no signal
 * handling here: pcntl does not exist on Windows, a guarded call to it would be
 * code nobody in this project can run, and correctness does not need it. The
 * cost of a hard kill is that the job runs again, which is the same cost every
 * at-least-once queue charges.
 *
 * **A job that kills its worker still runs out of attempts.** The attempt count
 * is incremented when the job is reserved, not when it finishes, so a job that
 * segfaults PHP every time is recorded as failed after its tries instead of
 * cycling forever. Counting on success would be the obvious way round and the
 * wrong one.
 *
 * **Timeout is a reservation, not an interruption.** Stopping a job in the
 * middle of a network read needs pcntl_alarm or a tick handler, neither of
 * which is portable here. What the timeout actually does is bound how long a
 * job can hold its claim: after it, another worker may take the job, so a
 * hung process delays work rather than stopping it. set_time_limit() is asked
 * as well, which handles the runaway-loop case where it is supported, and the
 * two together are what this framework can honestly enforce.
