/**
 * How much a request is allowed to be.
 *
 * Two checks, and the second is the interesting one.
 *
 * **A body over the limit is refused with 413.** Unbounded request bodies are
 * how a single client exhausts a server's memory: a JSON endpoint that decodes
 * whatever arrives will happily try to decode two hundred megabytes. The limit
 * is checked against Content-Length before anything reads the body, so the cost
 * of the refusal is a header parse.
 *
 * **A body PHP silently discarded is reported rather than ignored.** This is
 * the check worth having. When an upload exceeds post_max_size, PHP does not
 * fail: it hands the script an empty $_POST and an empty $_FILES, with
 * Content-Length still describing what was sent. The handler sees a form with
 * no fields and reports "name is required", the user swears the field was
 * filled in, and the actual cause is an ini setting nobody has looked at. The
 * symptom is indistinguishable from a bug in the application, so it is worth
 * the twenty lines to say what really happened.
 *
 * This runs on `request.received` and throws; the kernel turns an HttpException
 * into the right status without anything here knowing how errors are rendered.
