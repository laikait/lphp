/**
 * Where the security layer meets a request, and the answer to "but there is no
 * middleware".
 *
 * Four listeners on hooks the kernel already fires:
 *
 *   request.received    the size limit, before anything reads a body
 *   dispatch.before     CSRF and the rate limit, with the route in hand
 *   response.instance   the CSRF cookie, on the way out
 *   session.regenerated rotate the token when the identity changed
 *
 * This is what the specification's ban on middleware asks for and it is not a
 * workaround. A middleware stack is a pipeline every request walks whether or
 * not each layer has anything to say, ordered by a list somebody maintains, and
 * the usual failure is a layer that silently stopped running because it was
 * registered in the wrong place. Here the seams are named events, ordering is
 * a priority number, and **a listener refuses by throwing an HttpException** --
 * which the kernel already knows how to turn into a response, because that is
 * how 404 and 405 work.
 *
 * The cost is stated plainly: a listener cannot wrap the handler, so there is
 * no "do this after the response comes back, in the same closure". Nothing
 * here needs to; the response filter covers the other half.
 *
 * **CSRF is on unless a route opts out.** `meta(['csrf' => false])` for
 * endpoints authenticated by a bearer token rather than a cookie, where CSRF
 * has nothing to protect. Opt-out is the safe direction: the route somebody
 * adds in a hurry is protected by default, and it is reliably the one that
 * matters.
 *
 * **Rate limiting is off unless a route asks.** The opposite default, for the
 * opposite reason: a limit needs a number and a key that only the application
 * knows, and a framework-chosen one would either be too high to help or too low
 * to survive a real client.
