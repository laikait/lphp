 * client past its rate limit. Those are HttpExceptions, because they are
 * answers to a request -- 403, 413, 429 -- and the client is entitled to one.
 * Turning them into this class would make a routine rejection look like a
 * framework fault and would lose the status code on the way.

 * What is here is the other kind: a mistake in how the application is put
 * together, thrown where somebody can still fix it.
