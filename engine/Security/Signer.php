/**
 * The application key, and the two things it is for: signing and comparing.
 *
 * One class so that "how do we sign something" is answered once. A CSRF token,
 * a signed URL, a remember-me cookie and a session id all want the same
 * primitive, and four implementations of it is four chances to get the
 * comparison wrong.
 *
 *     $signed = $signer->sign($token);        // token.signature
 *     $token  = $signer->verify($signed);     // the token, or null
 *
 * **The signature is over a purpose as well as a value.** A token signed for
 * CSRF must not verify as a signed URL, or an attacker who can obtain one gets
 * the other for free; passing the context into the HMAC makes the two keys
 * different keys without there being two keys to manage.
 *
 * **Verification is constant time.** hash_equals compares every byte whatever
 * happens, so the time it takes does not say how many leading bytes were right.
 * This is not theoretical for a signature: a `===` here is a way to forge one
 * a byte at a time given enough requests.
 *
 * **An unkeyed application still works.** Without APP_KEY nothing can be
 * signed, and rather than pretend otherwise this reports isConfigured() as
 * false and refuses to sign. What depends on it -- CSRF -- degrades to a weaker
 * mode it can describe, instead of to a stronger-looking one it cannot deliver.
 * `security:check` says which mode is running.
