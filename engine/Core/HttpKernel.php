/**
 * Request in, response out.
 *
 * This is the one kernel. A browser request and a REST request are the same
 * thing arriving with different Accept headers; nothing here branches on which
 * it is, and there is no separate API framework.
 *
 * handle() is pure: it never echoes, never exits, never reads a superglobal and
 * never sends a header. That is what makes the whole request lifecycle testable
 * without a web server, and it is why every feature test in this project can
 * assert on a Response object rather than on captured output.
 *
 * Lifecycle extension points, in order:
 *
 *   request.instance    filter  the Request itself
 *   request.received    hook
 *   router.path         filter  the path about to be matched
 *   asset.response      filter  an asset response, when the path was one
 *   ... the MCP endpoint, when the path is it (MCP\Transport\HttpTransport) ...
 *   route.match         filter  the RouteMatch
 *   ... dispatch (see Dispatcher) ...
 *   request.failed      hook    on any Throwable
 *   error.response      filter  the error Response
 *   response.instance   filter  the final Response, always last
