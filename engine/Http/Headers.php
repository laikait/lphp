     * set or a rewrite copies it, on the reasoning that it is the server's own

     * specific.** Token authentication passes every test, works under `php -S`,

     * the request looks correct in the access log, because it was.
     *
     * Two fallbacks, in the order they are worth trusting. REDIRECT_ prefixed
     * copies survive an internal rewrite, which is how the .htaccess rule
     * passes it through. getallheaders() asks Apache what it actually received;
     * it exists only under some SAPIs, which is why it is a fallback and not
