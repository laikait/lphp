/**
 * Delivery: an asset URL in, an HTTP response out.
 *
 * The other half of "separate asset resolution from asset delivery". Nothing in
 * AssetManager knows this class exists; this class knows nothing about how a
 * URL was generated beyond the prefix they share. Either half can be replaced
 * without the other noticing, and in production the sensible replacement for
 * this one is the web server.
 *
 * **Why serve assets from PHP at all.** Because the specified layout puts
 * modules inside the web root and .htaccess denies the whole of modules/ -- it
 * has to, since module.php and every repository sits there. A module's
 * assets/ directory is therefore unreachable by Apache by design, and this is
 * what makes those files reachable without unlocking the directory that holds
 * the application's source. For the application's own assets/ directory, which
 * the web server can serve directly, letting it do so is faster and entirely
 * supported: the URL scheme is the same either way.
 *
 * **What this deliberately does not do.** Byte ranges. Without them, seeking
 * within a long video does not work, and the honest answer is that a video is
 * not something PHP should be streaming -- put it behind the web server or a
 * CDN. Saying "Accept-Ranges: none" states that plainly rather than letting a
 * client discover it by getting a whole file back when it asked for a slice.
