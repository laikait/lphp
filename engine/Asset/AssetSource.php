 * One published asset namespace: a logical name bound to a directory.
 *
 * A source is the entire mapping between the public URL space and the disk. It
 * is deliberately a value rather than a service: registering one publishes a
 * directory, and that is an act somebody should be able to read in a diff.
 *
 *     core                 ->  <base>/assets
 *     template             ->  <base>/templates/assets
 *     template + "admin"   ->  <base>/templates/admin/assets
 *     plugin  + "Example"  ->  <base>/modules/Plugins/Example/assets
 *     gateway + "Stripe"   ->  <base>/modules/Gateways/Stripe/assets
 *
 * The root is stored normalised but NOT resolved: a source may legitimately be
 * registered for a directory that does not exist yet (a template that ships no
 * assets, a plugin mid-installation). Resolution is where existence matters,
 * and that is AssetResolver's job, not this one's.
