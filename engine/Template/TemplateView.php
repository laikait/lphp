/**
 * What a template is handed: $view.
 *
 * A PHP template gets its data as local variables, plus `$view` and `$e`. This
 * is `$view`, and it is deliberately small — four things a template genuinely
 * cannot do without, and nothing else:
 *
 *     <?= $view->render('partials/row', ['customer' => $customer]) ?>
 *     <link rel="stylesheet" href="<?= $view->asset()->core('css/app.css') ?>">
 *     <?php if ($view->has('flash')): ?>…<?php endif ?>
 *     <?= $e($view->get('title', 'Customers')) ?>
 *
 * What it is not is a handle on the container. A template that can resolve
 * arbitrary services is a template that can run a query, and then the question
 * "what does this page do" stops having an answer you can read in the handler.
 * If a template needs something, the handler passes it in.
 *
 * It is also the reason a template never reaches for a global helper: $view is
 * already in scope, so there is nothing to reach for.
