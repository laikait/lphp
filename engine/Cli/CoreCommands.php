/**
 * The commands the framework itself provides.
 *
 * Registered through the same collector a module uses, with the module name
 * "engine" so that `module:list` and a duplicate-name error both tell the truth
 * about where a command came from. The kernel has no idea these are special,
 * because they are not: if this file were deleted the console would still work
 * and would simply have fewer commands.
 *
 * Every one of them answers a question that is otherwise expensive to answer --
 * what loaded, what routes exist, where templates are searched. None of them
 * generates code; nginx:make writes web server configuration, which nothing in
 * the framework reads. A make:something command writes a file whose shape the
 * framework then quietly depends on, and scaffolding is how a framework stops
 * being a library you call and starts being a thing you live inside.
