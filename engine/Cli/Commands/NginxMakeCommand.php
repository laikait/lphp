/**
 * Write the nginx server block for this application to nginx.conf.
 *
 * **It writes configuration, not source.** Nothing in the framework reads the
 * file, so it has no shape the framework quietly depends on -- which is what the
 * ban on generators is about. It is the nginx counterpart of public/.htaccess:
 * the root is public/, so nothing but the front controller and the assets can
 * be reached, and there is no list of directories to deny.
 *
 * **Generated rather than shipped** because the three values that differ per
 * machine -- the host name, the directory and the PHP-FPM address -- are wrong
 * in any copy that is not edited, and a server block pointing at the wrong root
 * fails open: nginx serves whatever the wrong directory holds.
 *
 * **It refuses to overwrite** without --force. A file somebody has since edited
 * by hand -- a TLS listener, a larger upload limit -- is exactly the file that
 * must not be silently regenerated.
