/**
 * Print a new APP_KEY.
 *
 * **It prints; it does not write.** Every other framework's equivalent edits
 * the .env file, and that convenience is exactly wrong for this value. Writing
 * it means the command has to find a .env, decide whether one already has a key,
 * and decide what to do when it does -- and the answer to the last is the only
 * one that matters, because silently replacing a live key invalidates every
 * token and session the application has issued. A command that cannot do that
 * by accident is worth the one copy and paste.
 *
 * It also means this is not a generator in the sense the specification bans. It
 * writes no file and creates no class; it reads 32 bytes from the CSPRNG and
 * shows them.
