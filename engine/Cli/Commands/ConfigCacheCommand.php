/**
 * Compile the configuration into one file.
 *
 * A deployment step, and the reason it is a step rather than a default is that
 * a cache with a stale-until-cleared contract should be something somebody
 * asked for. Once it exists it is used, which is why there is no setting to
 * switch it on: the setting would have to be read out of the configuration this
 * builds.
 *
 * The build deliberately re-reads everything from disk rather than writing out
 * the configuration this very process is running with. The running one has the
 * bootstrap's own overrides mixed in and may itself have come from an older
 * cache, and writing that back would compound both. It also runs with a cleared
 * environment log, so the fingerprint that ends up in the file describes the
 * variables this configuration genuinely depends on rather than every variable
 * the process has looked at.
