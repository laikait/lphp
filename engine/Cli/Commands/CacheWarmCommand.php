/**
 * Build the production boot path: the configuration cache and the module
 * discovery cache, in one deployment step.
 *
 * **Why a command and not a setting.** Both caches are stale-until-cleared, and
 * a stale-until-cleared cache has to be something somebody asked for at a moment
 * when nothing is about to change. A setting that makes the first request write
 * one is how a cache gets built on a laptop halfway through adding a module.
 * The file existing is the switch; this is how it comes to exist; cache:clear is
 * how it stops.
 *
 * **Why it refuses in debug.** A debug process ignores the module cache -- the
 * specification's development mode is "uncached module discovery" -- so warming
 * it there builds something nothing will read, and a configuration cache built
 * from a debug configuration is a debug configuration waiting to be deployed.
 *
 * **What it does not build, and why**, since the specification lists both:
 *
 *   Routes. A route is declared inside module.php, next to the hooks and
 *   services that must be registered on every boot regardless, so the
 *   declaration always runs; what a cache could skip is compiling the table,
 *   which measures at about 1.5 ms for 500 routes on an unoptimised machine and
 *   happens once per process, lazily, and never for a request that does not
 *   route. Handlers may also be closures, which no cache file can hold.
 *
 *   Dependency resolution. Tens of microseconds, and it depends on what every
 *   module.php declares -- a cached graph is wrong the first time somebody
 *   edits one.
 *
 * Both are benchmarked (composer bench), so the day either stops being true is
 * a number rather than a feeling.
