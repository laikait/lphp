/**
 * A .env file, for the machine that has no real environment to speak of.
 *
 * This exists because a developer's laptop and a CI container do not have
 * systemd units or an orchestrator to hand variables to the process. It is not
 * how production should be configured, and the specification is explicit that
 * .env must not be the only source: config/*.php files are the main one, this
 * fills in the variables those files read, and a real environment beats both.
 *
 * Two rules follow from that, and both matter:
 *
 * The real environment always wins. A value already present is never replaced,
 * so a .env file left behind on a server cannot quietly override what the
 * deployment set. That is the opposite of the usual "last loader wins" and it
 * is the reason this is safe to load unconditionally.
 *
 * Values are written to $_ENV only. putenv() is documented as not thread-safe,
 * this is a ZTS build of PHP, and a superglobal write costs nothing -- Env
 * reads $_ENV first precisely so this works.
 *
 * There is no variable interpolation. "${OTHER}" stays the six characters it
 * looks like. Interpolation turns a flat list of settings into a small
 * programming language with an evaluation order, and the first question it
 * raises -- does it see the real environment, the file, or both -- has no good
 * answer.
