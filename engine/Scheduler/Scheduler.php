/**
 * Decides what is due and runs it.
 *
 * There is **one cron line**, and this is what it calls:
 *
 *     * * * * *  cd /var/www/app && php bin/console schedule:run >> /dev/null 2>&1
 *
 * Every schedule in the application lives in the module that owns it, and the
 * crontab holds one entry that never changes. That is the entire trade the
 * scheduler makes: a machine's crontab is edited by whoever has shell access
 * and is not in version control, so anything expressed there is invisible to
 * the people who wrote the code and absent from the deployment that installs
 * it. Moving it into module.php makes a schedule reviewable, testable and
 * deleted along with the module that needed it.
 *
 * **It does not hold a process open.** Nothing here loops or sleeps. The
 * scheduler is cron's shape, not a daemon's: started once a minute, it decides,
 * it runs what is due, it exits. A resident scheduler has to be supervised,
 * restarted on deployment, and watched for having silently died -- and it buys
 * nothing an application scheduled in minutes can use.
 *
 * **A failing task does not stop the run.** Each is run inside its own try, so
 * a broken cleanup job does not take the billing run with it. The exit code of
 * `schedule:run` reports that something failed, which is what a monitoring
 * system reads.
 *
 * **Commands are dispatched in this process, not shelled out.** exec()ing a new
 * PHP would need the binary located, the command line quoted for two operating
 * systems, and would lose the container, the configuration and the log this
 * process has already built. The cost is that one task can exhaust the memory
 * or time of the run it shares -- which is why a long task is a job, put on the
 * queue and run by a worker instead.
