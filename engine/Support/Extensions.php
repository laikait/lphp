/**
 * The bridge between the global helpers and the subsystems behind them.
 *
 * This class is the one place the framework holds framework state statically,
 * and it exists to resolve a genuine tension: facades are banned, and the global
 * helpers add_hook()/apply_filter() are mandated. Those are only contradictory
 * if "reachable globally" and "facade" mean the same thing.
 *
 * A facade is a class with __callStatic that resolves ARBITRARY services from a
 * global container, producing call sites no static analyser can type, and
 * growing one class per service. This is a closed holder with one concrete
 * typed accessor per subsystem and no dynamic dispatch of any kind.
 *
 * **What decides the membership.** A subsystem belongs here when the
 * specification says application authors reach it globally: the hook and filter
 * helpers, asset() and template(). Those are the places with no constructor to
 * inject into -- a module.php file, a template, a one-off extension.
 * Everything else in the framework is injected, including from inside this
 * directory.
 *
 * That rule is the whole safety argument, and it has to be a rule about *why* a
 * member is here rather than a count, because a count is only ever one commit
 * from being changed to the next number. Adding a member means finding the
 * sentence in the specification that mandates a global for it. If there isn't
 * one, it is a service and it gets injected.
 *
 * Three rules keep it honest, all enforced by tests/Architecture:
 *
 *   1. The members are exactly those listed above, asserted by name. Growing
 *      the list is a design review, not a commit. The list is now closed: the
 *      specification mandates no further global.
 *   2. No file under engine/ may call a global helper, helpers.php excepted.
 *      Engine code takes its collaborators by constructor injection.
 *   3. There is no dynamic dispatch here and never will be. The moment a
 *      lookup takes a string, this is a service locator.
