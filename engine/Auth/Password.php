/**
 * Hashing and checking passwords, and nothing else.
 *
 * A thin wrapper over PHP's own functions, which are the right ones. What it
 * adds is three decisions that are easy to get wrong and invisible when they
 * are:
 *
 * **The algorithm is PASSWORD_DEFAULT, not a name.** Naming bcrypt pins the
 * application to whatever was current when somebody typed it; PASSWORD_DEFAULT
 * moves when PHP's default moves, and needsRehash() is what carries existing
 * users across. A hash records which algorithm made it, so old and new coexist
 * without a migration.
 *
 * **A missing account still costs a hash.** verify() against a null hash runs
 * against a dummy one rather than returning early. Otherwise a wrong username
 * answers in microseconds and a wrong password answers in fifty milliseconds,
 * and the difference is a way to find out which accounts exist -- worth having
 * because the usual next step is to try that name everywhere else.
 *
 * **The plaintext arrives as a Secret.** Not so that it cannot be read, but so
 * that reading it says reveal() at the call site. A password reaching here is a
 * password one var_dump away from a ticket.
