 * The access model was put together wrongly.
 *
 * Note what is NOT here: a wrong password, a request from a guest to a route
 * that needs a login, a user without the capability. Those are answers -- 401
 * and 403 -- that a client is entitled to, so they are HttpExceptions, and
 * turning them into this class would make a routine refusal look like a fault
 * and lose the status code on the way.
 *
 * What is here is a mistake in the declarations: a capability nobody defined, a
 * role that inherits itself, a provider that was never configured. All of them
 * are found at boot, which is the point -- an authorization mistake discovered
 * at runtime is discovered by whoever was wrongly allowed through.
