/**
 * One shape for every error an application returns.
 *
 * Before this existed, a 400 from a handler and a 500 from the kernel came out
 * of two different pieces of code that had agreed on a shape by coincidence. A
 * client parsing errors has to handle whatever arrives, so "by coincidence" is
 * the same as "not at all" the first time somebody edits one of them.
 *
 *     {
 *       "error": {
 *         "status": 422,
 *         "title": "Unprocessable Content",
 *         "message": "The customer could not be created.",
 *         "fields": { "email": ["must be an email address"] }
 *       }
 *     }
 *
 * status, title and message are always present and never change meaning.
 * Anything else is an addition under its own key, so a client that ignores the
 * keys it does not know keeps working.
 *
 * **Not RFC 9457 problem+json**, deliberately. That format nests the useful
 * part at the top level next to "type" and "instance" URIs that most APIs never
 * populate meaningfully, and it needs a content type browsers and tools handle
 * worse. This is the shape the demo already used, made official.
 *
 * Immutable: every with*() returns a copy, so an error can be built up and
 * passed around without a later addition changing an earlier holder's view.

     * The second half is the audience. An operator at a terminal already has
     * the source and the configuration, so a framework-authored message is
     * shown to them even in production -- see ErrorContext. A browser and an
     * API client never see one.
