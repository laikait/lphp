/**
 * Where the time went, inside one unit of work.
 *
 * **Off unless asked for**, and off means absent rather than idle: when
 * observability.profile is false nothing is attached to anything, so a hook
 * firing pays for a null check and not for a clock. The subsystems it measures
 * do not know it exists. Each exposes an observe() seam -- the hook and filter
 * engines, the module manager, database connections -- and this directory is the
 * only place those seams are connected: instrument() here, and
 * Report::watchQueries() for the connections. An architecture test keeps it that
 * way, so that "profiling is off" stays a statement about wiring rather than
 * about a flag every subsystem has to remember to check.
 *
 * **Aggregated, not a list of events.** A page fires a few thousand filter
 * listeners; recording each one would make profiling the slowest thing on the
 * page and a worker's memory grow without end. Each measurement is folded into a
 * running count, total and maximum under its name, and the number of distinct
 * names kept per category is capped. The one thing aggregation hides is the
 * order things happened in, and for "which query ran fifty times" the count is
 * the more useful answer anyway.
 *
 * **Scoped to traces.** Measurements go to the unit of work currently running.
 * When a job run inside a request ends, what it measured is added to the
 * request's, so the request's summary is inclusive and the job's is its own.
 *
 * **Times are inclusive.** A hook listener that applies a filter counts the
 * filter's time as its own, and the filter counts it again. The categories are
 * therefore not a breakdown that adds up to the request; they answer "how much
 * time was spent inside hooks" and "inside queries" separately, which is the
 * question somebody diagnosing a slow page is asking.
