/**
 * Where records go, and the guarantee that they never take the request with
 * them.
 *
 * The specification's hardest requirement in this area is one sentence:
 * *logging must not cause application failure when the primary operation
 * succeeds*. Everything unusual in this class follows from it.
 *
 * A writer that throws is caught, **retired** -- taken out of the rotation for
 * the rest of the process -- and the reason is kept. Retiring matters as much
 * as catching: a full disk does not un-fill itself, so a writer that failed
 * once will fail on every record, and a request that logs forty times would
 * otherwise spend forty exceptions finding that out. The reason is kept because
 * the failure mode of "catch everything" is an application that has silently
 * not been logging for three weeks, which is worse than the exception was.
 *
 * Reentrancy is refused for the same reason. A writer that logs -- or a
 * hook listener that logs while handling a log-driven error -- would recurse
 * until the stack ran out, and a stack overflow caused by the logger is exactly
 * the failure the rule forbids.
 *
 * Filtering happens here rather than in the writers, so a record below the
 * threshold costs one integer comparison and never has its context normalised.
 * For an application that logs at debug in development and info in production,
 * that is most of the cost of logging at all.
