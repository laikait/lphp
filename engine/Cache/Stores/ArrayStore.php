/**
 * Memory, for the length of one process.
 *
 * The default, and not a placeholder. A request that renders a page resolves
 * the same template name from several partials, builds the same asset URL in a
 * layout and a view, and asks the same question of a repository more than once;
 * this makes the second of each free, costs nothing, writes nothing, and cannot
 * go stale because it does not outlive the answer.
 *
 * It is the default rather than the file store for the same reason the log has
 * no writers by default: a framework that starts writing files into a directory
 * nobody asked about is one that fills a disk on somebody else's machine.
 * Caching across requests is a deployment's decision, and CACHE_STORE=file is
 * how it says so.
 *
 * Nothing is serialised, so an entry hands back the same object it was given.
 * That is a genuine difference from every other store and it is worth knowing
 * about: code that mutates something it got from the cache will be seen to do
 * so here and not elsewhere. The conformance test for the file store covers the
 * other half.
