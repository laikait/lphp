/**
 * The cache an application is given.
 *
 * Injected, always. There is no Cache::get(), no cache() helper and no static
 * anything in this directory -- the specification bans a static cache API by
 * name, and an architecture test holds it. What that ban buys is ordinary: a
 * class that takes a Cache can be given one that stores nothing, or one that
 * counts what it was asked, and its test does not need a cache at all.
 *
 * The split is the same one the logging layer uses. A CacheStore is where bytes
 * go -- memory, a file, one day a Redis -- and this is the thing with the
 * behaviour: key rules, namespaces, a default lifetime, and remember(). Adding
 * a backend means writing five methods, not reimplementing any of this.
 *
 *     $this->cache->remember('customers.count', fn() => $this->query->total(), 300);
 *
 * A namespace is a prefix, and namespace() hands back another Cache rather than
 * mutating this one, so a module can hold its own without affecting whoever
 * gave it out:
 *
 *     $billing = $cache->namespace('billing');   // keys become "billing:..."
 *     $billing->clear();                         // and only those go
