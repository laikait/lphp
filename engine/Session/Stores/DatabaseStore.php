/**
 * Sessions in a table, which is what "distributed sessions" actually means.
 *
 * The file store is correct and fast and only works on one machine. The moment
 * there are two web servers behind a load balancer, a user's next request lands
 * somewhere that has never heard of them. Sticky sessions push the problem
 * around -- and lose every session on that node when it restarts. A shared
 * table is the version with no asterisk, and the database is already there.
 *
 * Every statement goes through the query builder, so the store runs on each
 * database the builder writes for.
 *
 * **The lock is a row lock, taken inside a transaction.** lockForUpdate(),
 * which is FOR UPDATE on MySQL and PostgreSQL and UPDLOCK on SQL Server,
 * gives exactly the guarantee the interface asks for: one writer at a time,
 * per session, for the length of one read-modify-write rather than the length
 * of a request.
 *
 * SQLite has no row locking; it locks the whole database file for a write. That
 * is correct but not concurrent, and under two simultaneous writers one of them
 * gets "database is locked". It is fine for development and for the test suite,
 * which is what it is used for here.
 *
 * **The table is not created on a request.** A store that issues DDL on its
 * first request needs permissions in production that nothing should have, and
 * it does it at the worst possible time. `migrate` creates it, from
 * SessionTableMigration, while session.store is "database".
 *
 * The id and the timestamps appear both as columns and inside the JSON, and
 * that duplication is deliberate. The columns exist so that the sweep is one
 * indexed DELETE rather than a read loop; the JSON is the canonical record, so
 * every store in this framework decodes the same bytes with the same code and
 * a session written by one can be read by another.
