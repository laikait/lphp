/**
 * Sessions in this process's memory, for tests and for the console.
 *
 * **Never right for a web application**, and session:check says so: a request
 * is a process that ends, so a session kept in its memory has been forgotten
 * before the response reaches the browser. It is here because a test that
 * exercises logging in should not leave files on the machine running it, and
 * because a console command that touches a session needs somewhere to put one.
 *
 * **It encodes and decodes exactly like the file store.** That is the part
 * worth noticing. A memory store that simply held the array would accept a PDO
 * connection, a closure or a model object without complaint -- and the
 * application would pass its tests and then fail in production against a store
 * that has to write the value down. Round-tripping through the same JSON makes
 * "it worked in tests" mean something.
