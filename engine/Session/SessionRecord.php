/**
 * What a store holds: an id, some data, and three timestamps.
 *
 * The timestamps are separate on purpose, because they answer three different
 * questions and a single "updated at" answers none of them well.
 *
 * - createdAt bounds the ABSOLUTE lifetime. A session that has been alive for
 *   a week is suspicious however busy it has been; without this, a session kept
 *   warm by a background poll never expires at all.
 * - touchedAt bounds the IDLE lifetime, which is the one users experience as
 *   "it logged me out while I was at lunch".
 * - successor is the grace pointer left behind by regenerate(). See there.
 *
 * A plain class rather than an array because a store that receives an array
 * eventually receives one with a key missing, and the failure surfaces three
 * layers away as "undefined index" in something that only reads sessions.
