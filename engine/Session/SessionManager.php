/**
 * Policy: when a session is loaded, when it is written, and what the cookie

 * either.
 *
 * **Nothing is loaded until something asks.** A request that never touches the
 * session does no storage read, no storage write and sets no cookie. That is
 * not an optimisation, it is what keeps a JSON API from handing out session
 * cookies to clients that will never send them back, and it is why flash data
 * survives a background poll (see Session).
 *
 * The consequence worth stating: there is no "current session" on a request
 * that did not use one, and active() answers honestly rather than starting one
 * to be able to say yes.
 *
 * **Two listeners, no middleware.** onRequest() on request.received remembers
 * which request is being served; onResponse() on response.instance writes the
 * session and attaches the cookie. Between them the handler does whatever it
 * likes, including nothing.
