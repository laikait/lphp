/**
 * The session, as a handler sees it.
 *
 * Type-hint it and the container hands you this request's session; there is no
 * $_SESSION, no session_start(), and no global to reach for. That is not
 * purism. PHP's own session machinery keeps the data in a superglobal, the id
 * in engine state, and the configuration in ini settings, which together mean a
 * session cannot be constructed in a test, cannot be swapped for a fake, and
 * cannot be reasoned about without knowing what the SAPI did before the script
 * ran.
 *
 * **This object records changes, it does not write them.** Every set() and
 * forget() goes into a change log, and the log -- not the whole array -- is
 * what gets merged into storage at the end of the request. See SessionStore for
 * why that is the difference between two concurrent requests both working and
 * one of them silently losing.
 *
 * **Flash data lives in the payload like anything else.** flash('status', ...)
 * sets an ordinary key and adds its name to a list of things to delete one
 * request later, so reading it is just get('status'). The alternative -- a
 * separate flash bag with its own accessors -- means every template that shows
 * a message has to know which kind of value it is.
 *
 * The ageing rule is worth knowing because it fixes a bug people usually live
 * with: flash data ages on requests that TOUCH the session, and this session is
 * lazy. A background poll that never reads the session does not eat the message
 * meant for the next page the user opens.
