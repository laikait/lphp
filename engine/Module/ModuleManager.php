/**
 * Drives the module lifecycle: Discover, Load, Resolve, Register, Boot, Ready.
 *
 * What is legal in each stage:
 *
 *   Discover   No user code runs at all. The filesystem is scanned for
 *              module.php files under the configured roots, each candidate is
 *              checked for containment, and definitions are built from plain
 *              scalars. This is the stage a cache can replace wholesale.
 *              A request for an asset stops here -- see prepareAssets().
 *
 *   Load       Each module.php closure runs and RECORDS its declarations.
 *              Nothing is bound, routed or hooked yet, so a module cannot
 *              observe whether it happened to load before or after another.
 *              A module named in modules.disabled is skipped here: its
 *              module.php never runs at all.
 *
 *   Resolve    Dependencies are checked across every module at once -- missing,
 *              disabled, wrong version, circular -- and the registration order
 *              is fixed. It is the only moment every declaration is known and
 *              none has taken effect. See DependencyResolver.
 *
 *   Register   Declarations are replayed across every module, BY CATEGORY:
 *              config, then assets and templates, then services, then
 *              routes, then commands, then schedules, then hooks, then
 *              filters.
 *              This is the important detail. Replaying per module instead
 *              would mean one module's route registration could run before
 *              another's service bindings, which is precisely the ordering
 *              bug service providers are famous for. By category, all config
 *              exists before any factory is defined, and every service is
 *              bound before any route is registered.
 *
 *   Boot       onBoot callbacks run in module order, with their parameters
 *              injected. Everything is registered by now, so cross-module work
 *              is safe here and only here.
 *
 *   Ready      Nothing further happens; the contexts are frozen.
