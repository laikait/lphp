 *
 * The direction is the point. The module declares page_size = 25 in its
 * module.php; that is a default, written by whoever wrote the module. This file
 * is the decision, made by whoever runs the installation, and it wins -- even
 * though the module registers long after this file is read.
 *
 * Only the keys named here are overridden. The rest of the module's defaults
 * are untouched, so this file never has to be kept in step with the module's.
