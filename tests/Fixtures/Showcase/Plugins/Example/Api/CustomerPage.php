/**
 * The customer list, in whichever representation the client asked for.
 *
 * One route, two media types, and the interesting part is how little code the
 * second one costs. There is no separate web kernel and no separate API kernel:
 * a browser request and a REST request are the same request arriving with
 * different Accept headers, so answering both is a branch rather than an
 * architecture.
 *
 *     curl /customers                                 -> the page
 *     curl -H 'Accept: application/json' /customers   -> the payload
 *     curl /customers.json                            -> the payload, for clients
 *                                                        that cannot set Accept
 *
 * The JSON branch delegates to ListCustomers -- the same handler the .json
 * route uses -- so the two representations cannot drift apart. Duplicating the
 * query here is how they would.
