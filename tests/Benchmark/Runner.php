/**
 * Times benchmarks, and compares a run against a saved one.
 *
 * **How a number is produced.** The timed closure is run until a round takes
 * long enough for the clock to be meaningful (the calibration), then that many
 * calls are timed several times over. The figure reported is the median round,
 * divided by the calls in it; the spread beside it is how far apart the fastest
 * and slowest rounds were. A benchmark with a spread of 40% is telling you the
 * machine was busy, not that the code is slow.
 *
 * **What "regression" can mean here, honestly.** A timing is a fact about the
 * machine that produced it. Comparing this laptop against a CI runner is noise,
 * and so is comparing a run with opcache against one without -- which is why a
 * saved run records both, and a comparison refuses to pretend across them. The
 * useful comparison is the same machine before and after a change, which is
 * what --save and --compare are for. What must never regress regardless of
 * machine -- an asset request running no module code, a cached boot scanning no
 * directory -- is asserted exactly, in the test suite, where it fails the gate.
