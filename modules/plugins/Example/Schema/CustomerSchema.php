 * The customer contract, in both directions.
 *
 * Two things to notice. The first is that this is not a class anybody extends
 * and not something a handler signature pulls in automatically: it is a plain
 * class with static factories returning a value, and the API handler calls it
 * where it chooses to.
 *
 * The second is that the resource contract is derived from the input one rather
 * than written out again. A customer that comes back has everything a customer
 * that goes in has, plus an identity, so saying that once is both shorter and
 * impossible to get out of step.
