/**
 * The REST surface for customers.
 *
 * The API belongs to the capability that owns it: this lives in the Customer
 * module, not in a global controllers directory. It uses the same kernel, the
 * same router and the same dispatcher as any other route -- there is no API
 * framework here, only a handler that happens to answer in JSON.
 *
 * Nothing is extended and nothing is implemented. The only API-specific things
 * on this page are two static factories, ApiResponse and ErrorDocument, and
 * both are conveniences the handler chose rather than machinery it inherited.
