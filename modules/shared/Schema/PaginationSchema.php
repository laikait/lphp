/**
 * The page and page-size contract every list endpoint shares.
 *
 * This is what belongs in shared: one rule about how large a page may be, in
 * one place, so a new list endpoint cannot quietly allow per_page=100000 and
 * take the database down with it.
 *
 * Note the input this describes. A query string is entirely strings, so
 * "page=2" has to become 2 before anything can compare it to a bound -- which
 * is exactly what a schema does, and why the same declaration serves a query
 * string and a JSON body without knowing which it was given.
